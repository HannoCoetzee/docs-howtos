# Data Grid

View, explore, and edit large amounts of data in a familiar spreadsheet interface with the Data Grid component for Reactive Web apps.

Use the Data Grid to create enterprise-grade interfaces that are more suitable and time-effective than designing a custom solution every time you need to manipulate dense datasets.  

**Key features** 

Built for Reactive Web apps 
Data selection and editing in a familiar interface 
Data sorting by parameter 
Data grouping 
Virtual Scrolling 


To access a sample version of Data Grid, you can download the Data Grid Sample from Forge and launch it in Service Studio.  We're continually improving this solution and adding more features. To help us cover more specific and complex scenarios, let us know what you'd like to see in this component's support tab. 

The goal for the Data Grid Reactive component is to help you develop applications that need data visualization and manipulation features that are not currently covered by other components.

This sample application has two purposes: to document the Data Grid features and to show how to implement the features by inspecting the code. Hopefully this will ease your development process and let you extract the full potencial of the components features.
