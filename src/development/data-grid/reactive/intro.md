# Data Grid

The Data Grid component allows you to view, explore, and edit large amounts of data in a familiar spreadsheet interface.

You can use the Data Grid component to create enterprise-grade interfaces that are more suitable and time-effective than designing a custom solution every time you need to manipulate dense datasets.  

The Data Grid component has the following key features: 

* Data selection and editing in a familiar interface 
* Data sorting by parameter 
* Data grouping 
* Virtual Scrolling 

For more information on how to use the Data Grid component for Traditional Web apps, see [How to use Data Grid Web](faq.md)

For more information on how to use the Data Grid component for Reactive Web apps, see [How to use the Data Grid component](how-to-view-data.md). 

You can also check out a quick Data Grid tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFXOPrkRlrI)

You can also download a [sample version of the Data](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/9765/data-grid-sample-reactive) from Forge and launch it in Service Studio. This sample application documents the Data Grid features and shows how to implement the features by inspecting the code. 

<!--We're continually improving this solution and adding more features. To help us cover more specific and complex scenarios, let us know what you'd like to see in this component's support tab. 

The goal for the Data Grid Reactive component is to help you develop applications that need data visualization and manipulation features that are not currently covered by other components.
